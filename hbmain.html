        <p>Sitting too much is seriously bad for your health.

            People who sit a lot every day have an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death .
            
            Additionally, sitting all the time burns very few calories, and many studies have linked it to weight gain and obesity 
            
            This is a major problem for office workers, because they sit down for most of the day. Fortunately, standing desks are becoming increasingly more popular.<a class="hbbutton" href="hb.html">Read more</a></p>

        <p>If you have a sedentary lifestyle, you may find yourself sitting for long periods of time. Before working at a sit-stand desk, I always knew sitting was bad, but I was never proactive enough to do anything about it. I would find myself sitting for 1-3 hours at a time. With a busy schedule and working long hours, you can end up sitting for long periods during the day.

            Sitting disease is a term used by health experts to describe the numerous issues caused by sitting all day. Now that I have the ability to sit and stand during my workday, I have personally noticed many health benefits. After doing my research, I have created a list of health benefits you can expect when using a standing desk, so you can prevent sitting disease.<a class="hbbutton" href="hb1.html">Read more</a></p>

            When I'm performing an ergonomic assessment or providing some ergonomic advice to a client, I often get asked "how long should I stand at my standing desk?".

            There is no question that there are many benefits of stand up desks to be had. But, can too much of a good thing be detrimental? In some cases, standing too long can have negative effects - which is the last thing you want after investing in standing desks.

        <h2>How To Find A Comfy Office Chair</h2>

        <p>It is possible to find a comfy office chair that fits you well. All you have to do is follow these five tips. This will ensure your next office chair purchase is the right one.When it comes to overall fit, it is always nice if the chair fits your right out of the box. If not, hopefully there are enough adjustments so that you can easily fine-tune the fit. The most commonly found adjustment is the seat height which allows you to move the seat up and down so that you can find a height where your feet can sit flat.

            Arm adjustment options is another feature that you will want to pay attention to. That fact is that most cheaper office chairs come with little to no arm adjustment capabilities. In top tier chairs, you will find four-way arm adjustments so that you can adjust arm height, width, depth along with being able to pivot the arms.
            
            Another important factor to consider for fit is whether you are getting the right seat.   <a class="hbbutton" href="hb3.html">Read more</a>  </p>
