            <p class="hbp">It is possible to find a comfy office chair that fits you well. All you have to do is follow these five tips. This will ensure your next office chair purchase is the right one.

                <br> <br>

                <h1 class="hbh1text"> 1. Overall Fit</h1> <br>
               <img src="img/c1.jpg" alt="" class="hbimg"><br>
               <h1 class="hbimgtext">Overall fit for user and their workstation</h1> <br> 
               
                <p class=" hbptext  ">When it comes to overall fit, it is always nice if the chair fits your right out of the box. If not, hopefully there are enough adjustments so that you can easily fine-tune the fit. The most commonly found adjustment is the seat height which allows you to move the seat up and down so that you can find a height where your feet can sit flat.

                Arm adjustment options is another feature that you will want to pay attention to. That fact is that most cheaper office chairs come with little to no arm adjustment capabilities. In top tier chairs, you will find four-way arm adjustments so that you can adjust arm height, width, depth along with being able to pivot the arms.
                
                Another important factor to consider for fit is whether you are getting the right seat. We get a lot of questions about seat comfort from users who are 250 pounds or more and taller than 6 feet. What we find is that any chair with a frame that surrounds the seat can be limiting and restrictive to larger users. If you fall into this category, you will want to take the time to measure both yourself and the chair to make sure it will be a good fit.
                
                Lastly, back width and height should be taken into consideration well before you buy your chair. If the seat back is too narrow, there is nothing you can do to change that. However, some ergonomic chairs do come with a seat height adjustment, which provides more flexibility for taller users.</p><br> <br> <br>
              <h1 class="hbh1text">2. Seat Comfort</h1> <br> 
               <img src="img/c2.jpg" alt="" class="hbimg"><br>
              <h1 class="hbimgtext"> Testing the seat pad firmness</h1> <br> 
             
             <p class=" hbptext  "> Seat comfort is by far the most subjective feature that we try to measure. What you will find in more high end chairs is that they come with a thin, firm seat pad. This is by design since most ergonomists recommend this type of seat for better posture and prolonged use. If you prefer a more padded seat, there are certainly options, but keep in mind that they might not provide the type of support you will need. </p><br> <br>
              <h1 class="hbh1text">3. Back Comfort</h1><br> 
              <img src="img/c3.jpg" alt="" class="hbimg"><br>
              <h1 class="hbimgtext">Backrest hitting shoulder blades</h1> <br> 
              
             <p class=" hbptext  "> First and foremost, you will want to make sure that the seat back actually fits you. If the seat back isn’t tall enough, you can end up with uncomfy pressure points. In addition, we’ve found that some chair backs are too narrow and include obtrusive bits of plastic or a lumbar support that is too aggressive. In our office, Ryan actually took the lumbar support out of the Leap V2 because he found it to be too intrusive.

              <br> <br>
               <h1 class="hbh1text">4. Lumbar Support</h1><br> 
              <img src="img/c4.jpg" alt="" class="hbimg"><br>
              <h1 class="hbimgtext">Checking Lumber Support</h1> <br> 
              
            
             <p class=" hbptext  "> When it comes to lumbar support, you want to look at the fit and how well it functions with your body. A lot of chairs simply come with a natural curve that is meant to provide some support, but if it doesn’t hit your back in the right place, you’ll want to opt for a chair with lumbar adjustments.

              Some chairs come with lumber height adjustments and/or tension controls so that you can achieve the right fit. If you spend a lot of time reclining in your office chair, you will definitely want lumber height adjustment capabilities. These are features you will want to look for to ensure maximum comfort.
             </p>
              <br> <br>
              <h1 class="hbh1text">5.Arm Comfort</h1> <br> 
              <img src="img/c5.jpg" alt="" class="hbimg"><br>
              <h1 class="hbimgtext">Checking arm pad softness</h1> <br> 
              
             <p class=" hbptext  "> Arm comfort is different from arm fit. Specifically, you should think about the firmness of the arm pad and find one that fits your preferences. For example, I enjoy the arm pads on the Amia because they are padding throughout and come with soft, rounded edges. I can really lean into them without hitting a hard surface.</p><br> <br>
               <h1 class="hbh1text"> 6. Headrest Comfort </h1><br> 
                 <img src="img/c6.jpg" alt="" class="hbimg"><br>
                 <h1 class="hbimgtext">Adjusting Leap headrest</h1> <br> 
                       
           <p class=" hbptext  ">  A lot of people feel like they should have a head rest, but honestly, if you spend a lot of time in your office chair, the head rest rarely gets used and can even uncomfortably push your head forward. If you do decide that you absolutely need a headrest, consider exactly how you will be using the chair. There are two basic styles: a roll headrest that fits into the curve of your neck and a more standard headrest like you would see in a car that bumps up against the back of your head. Neither style is all that great for tasking, but they can offer support if you are
             reclining. Again, you’ll need to find the right height, so look for headrests that are adjustable.</p> <br> <br>
              

             <h1 class=" hbh1text  ">  Final Thoughts </h1><br> <br>
             
             <p class=" hbptext  ">  If you prioritize these six areas of comfort and fit, you will be able to enjoy your office chair throughout the day.</p>
